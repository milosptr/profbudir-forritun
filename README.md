# Flight system 1

### Objective:

You are a budding software developer tasked with creating an innovative system to manage and process flight data for a bustling international airport. Your mission is to develop an application that not only keeps track of various flight details but also offers interactive features for users to query and save flight information based on different criteria.

### Background:

Imagine an airport bustling with activities: planes arriving and departing, passengers bustling about, and the constant hum of travel. In this dynamic environment, managing flight information efficiently is crucial. Your system needs to handle data for flights, including their numbers, associated airlines, destinations, departure times, and whether they are arrivals or departures.

Your application should be capable of interacting with users, allowing them to choose from a variety of options to view flight data. These options include listing all arrivals and departures for the current day, checking flights to a specific destination, and viewing flights scheduled for a specific hour.

Additionally, the system must be designed to read flight information from a pre-existing dataset and enable users to save selected flight details externally for future reference.

### Outcome:

By the end of this project, you will have developed a fully functional flight management application that:

1. Reads and processes flight data from an external source.
2. Provides an interactive interface for users to select different options for viewing flight information.
3. Allows users to save specific flight information based on their queries.
4. Implements sophisticated data handling and processing techniques to ensure efficiency and usability.
